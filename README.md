# Overview
This package contains a small set of spinorbital coupled-cluster codes. `Miniccpy` uses PySCF to perform SCF calculations
(e.g., RHF/ROHF/UHF) and obtains the reference state along with one- and two-body molecular orbital integrals through a 
native interface. 

The main purpose of this package is for fun! However, it can also be useful for understanding the basics of deriving and
implementing the simplest spinorbital form of high-level coupled-cluster methods.

In making this package, I took some of the layout from the excellent code `pdaggerq` from Prof. Eugene DePrince's group at Florida
State University.
